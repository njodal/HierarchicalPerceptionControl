# Hierarchical Perception Control

It is a pretty simple implementation of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). 

This framework is a Domain Specific Language designed that allow to define a hierarchy of control unit to control any kind of process. 

The hierarchy is defined in a declarative way in a YAML file, so no hard code procedural programming (like Python) is needed.

A set of examples (like controlling an inverted pendulum or a car) is provided.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/njodal/HierarchicalPerceptionControl/wiki) for more details.
